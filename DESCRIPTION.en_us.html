This is a variable version of Roboto intended to be a 1:1 match with the official non-variable release from Google.

This is not an official Google project, but was enabled with generous funding by Google Fonts, who contracted Type Network.
The Roboto family of instances contained 6 weights and two widths of normal, along with italic of the regular width.
The project began by taking UFO instances generated during the build process of the Roboto v2.136 release, which have quadratic outlines. 
The Thin, Regular and Bold UFOs required some fixes for interpolation compatibility, and a build script was written that preserves outline overlaps.
